# ag-slam
Ag-Slam is an educational tool for introducing students to Visual SLAM and Visual Odometry in an agricultural setting. To make this more accessible for everyday students and researchers, a few algorithms that have performed well in urban settings have been included as submodules to the project. Each of these has been provided with dockerfiles in order to run these algorithms without needing to install all of the dependencies. In fact, only a basic ros installation will be required to run visualizations.
